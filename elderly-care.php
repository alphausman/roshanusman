<p><b>100+ NABH hospitals associated | 5000+ doctors | 35+ specialties | 120+ specialists for 2nd opinion | 24X7 availability</b></p>
<p>The first seed of the ivhSeniorCare was sown in the mind of Dr. Manreet Kahlon when she came across
the family system of the defence forces after getting married to a naval officer. Coming from a civilian
family she always wished for similar services for her parents. It took hard work of around 6 years to
transform her wish into reality. Swadeep Srivastava, a seasoned entrepreneur in the healthcare domain,
joined hands with Dr. Manreet to establish ivhSeniorCare.</p>
<p>ivhSeniorCare is not only about the eldercare but it is an umbrella for all your social and healthcare
needs. Whether a person needs domiciliary support or ICU support, we are the solution. We already
have 500+ satisfied customers and numbers are increasing with every passing day.</p>

<p><b>Swadeep</b> is a passionate to serving mankind, a part of which he fulfils by advising and helping friends and business associates in choosing the right treatment. Realizing that most of the people face challenges while choosing the doctors and treatments, he envisioned the India Virtual Hospital (IVH)</p>
<font color=blue><p class="ivh" ><a class="color"href="https://www.indiavirtualhospital.com/">www.indiavirtualhospital.com.</a></p></font>					
	<p class="ulockd-abt-ondtls-para"><b></b> <b>Swadeep</b> started his career as chief PRO for Indraprastha Apollo hospitals and played a huge role in establishing the Apollo group in North India. He started his entrepreneurial career by establishing India’s 1st ‘specialist’ Healthcare PR firm ViaMedia Health in 2000, which he nurtured through 15 years. To venture into public sector, Swadeep needed capital and IT support, which he gained by merging ViaMedia Health with EBIX Inc., where he served as Country Head before starting the India Virtual Hospital (IVH) www.ivh.health. In this journey when ‘health marketing & communications’ got better defined, Swadeep was fortunate to associate & work closely for strategizing & implementing ‘specialist marketing & communications’ solutions, with India’s top medical bodies (IMA, MCI, CSI, etc.) as well as with topmost Consumer Healthcare Cos, Pharmaceutical Cos, and Medical Device Cos. Swadeep also founded HEAL Foundation (www.healfoundation.in) with the objective of building capacity of country’s health writers and spread awareness around key health issues in the masses. In the past 15 years, HEAL Foundation has conducted over 150 regional workshops for capacity building of health writers and 5 national level conventions to provide the country’s health writers to learn from industry experts, network, share and learn from their peers.</p>
